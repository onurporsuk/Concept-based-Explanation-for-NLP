      "Substring 'unimaginative' found in string at index 42095: There are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside, or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire, but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull.\n",
      "Substring 'unimaginative' found in string at index 43354: Based on a play with a rather unimaginative title and then adapted into a reasonably enjoyable book, it fails to engage, convince or even remotely interest its audience on a most fundamental level.\n",
      "Substring 'unimaginative' found in string at index 44045: Stale predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack, punctuate this noxious mental narcotic's nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill, or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma.\n",

      "1: Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well made film about a pickpocket (Richard Widmark) who inadvertently aquires top-secret microfilm and becomes a target for espionage agents.\n",
      "2: Haunting long takes, a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt, barking dogs.\n",
      "3: It is a psychological thriller.\n",
      "4: Standing out strongly is its sultrily lurid and bleak nature that's intrusively planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative strangle hold in sexual depravity.\n",
      "5: The former prizefighter, who once faced Joe Louis in the ring, delivers an Academy Award-winning portrayal of disgraced IRA soldier Gypo Nolan on the worst night of his life.\n",
      "6: A River Runs Through It is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, Norman and Paul, (Brad Pitt and Craig Sheffer) whose Reverend father (Tom Skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and his sons, there is a fine line between the two.\n",
      "7: Carter's depiction of an ALS victim is strong, perhaps even overdone at times (sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings).\n",
      "8: I just re-watched this thriller, one I had previously believed to be one of Hitch's lesser efforts.\n",
      "9: New York lensed horror film (filmed in part on Staten Island which no doubt brought the spirit of Andy Milligan lurking about) is one of the better horror comedies to come around in a while.\n",
      "10: The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense, action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences.\n",

      "4: Always makes me cry.\n",
      "5: Losing your love is painful beyond belief, and many who do so will never feel something like that again.\n",
      "6: There are moments that will bring tears to your eyes as well.\n",
      "7: I will never forget.\n",
